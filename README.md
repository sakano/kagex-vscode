# KAG/KAGEX for Visual Studio Code

Adds KAG/KAGEX language support for Visual Studio Code.

I recommend installing [tjs-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Biscrat.tjs-vscode) for syntax highlighting between "iscript" and "endscript".

# Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Some snippets. Currently only for emb, if, ignore, iscript, macro
- The codes between ";#region" and ";#endregion" can be folded

# Issues
Submit the [issues](https://github.com/sakano/kagex-vscode/issues) if you find any bug or have any suggestion.
